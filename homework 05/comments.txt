First is my answer:
As I tested, the FR is very sensitive to parameters. If we choose a very good parameter set, it can perform as well as CG PR+, but if they are badly chosen, it took much longer time, over 200 epoches to get converged in this problem. And CG PR+ is the most stable one as I tested, the performance is almost the same, and it can converge very fast, within 60 epoches. And SGD is the slowest, in my testing cases, it will not get converged within 10000 epoches.

Below is the result:
